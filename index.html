                    I’ve been a musician since the age of nine, and my journey has always been intertwined with education, innovation, and technology.<br><br> During my undergraduate studies in Musical Composition, I was introduced to programming through C language, and although it was just a single course, the experience sparked a lasting interest in the field which I could realize only in 2021.<br><br>
                    My career in music has led me to work as a teacher, an award-winning recorder player, and an entrepreneur. <br><br>I’ve taught at the Espírito Santo College of Music, won first place in the solo recorder competition at The Wharfedale Music Festival (UK), and taught at the Brasília School of Music. As a music teacher I have also eworked for primary and secondary schools with experience in Norwich(England) at Eaton Primary School, and over 10 years of experience in this field I’ve also conducted workshops at the Brasília Museum of Art and participated in projects supported by the Cultural Support Fund (DF) and the Department of the Environment.<br><br>As a musician
                    I had promoted early music and Brazilian popular music concerts for more than 20 years up to 2021 where I felt the need of re-think about my music performance career.<br><br>
                    As a musicologist my main interest is about music expression and technoly and I believe in the potential of combining art and technology to create innovative solutions for the music world.

        <h2>Tech & Innovation</h2>
        <p class="paragraph">The intersection of technology and the arts has always been a major focus of my career. My journey into the tech world began with my interest in programming and continued as I explored ways to integrate innovation into the music industry. Through my work at Master Música, I’ve been able to create and implement technological solutions that make a real impact on musicians’ careers.

            I specialize in Fullstack development with expertise in Java, AWS, Docker, SQL, Node.js, JavaScript, Agile Scrum, and QA. With a deep understanding of both technology and the arts, I’m able to bridge these two worlds to deliver solutions that are both creative and effective.
            
            My vision is to continue pushing the boundaries of what is possible at the intersection of music and technology, developing tools that empower artists to innovate and succeed in the digital era.</p>
