        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p class="paragraph">I’ve been a musician since the age of nine, and my journey has always been intertwined with education, innovation, and technology. During my undergraduate studies in Musical Composition, I was introduced to programming through C language. Although it was just a single course, the experience sparked a lasting interest in the field.

            My career in music has led me to work as a teacher, an award-winning flutist, and an entrepreneur. I’ve taught at the Espírito Santo College of Music, won first place in the solo recorder competition at The Wharfedale Music Festival (UK), and taught at the Brasília School of Music. I’ve also conducted workshops at the Brasília Museum of Art and participated in projects supported by the Cultural Support Fund (DF) and the Department of the Environment.
            
            In 2015, I founded Master Música, a startup selected for the Startup-DF program by SEBRAE, aimed at transforming musicians' career management through technology. This experience deepened my vision of how innovation can elevate the arts, motivating me to expand my knowledge in software development.
            
            In 2021, I was awarded a scholarship from Mercado Livre and Globant to study at Digital House (now Rocketseat), where I completed my Fullstack Web Developer training with a focus on Java. Around the same time, I enrolled in courses at DIO, following recommendations from professors who had also been my mentors at Digital House.
            
            Today, I bring together my expertise in music, education, and technology to create innovative solutions. Both music and programming require logical thinking, creativity, and structured problem-solving. I believe in the immense potential that lies in the intersection of art and technology, and I continue to explore new ways to connect these worlds.</p>

        <h2>Tech & Innovation</h2>
        <p class="paragraph">The intersection of technology and the arts has always been a major focus of my career. My journey into the tech world began with my interest in programming and continued as I explored ways to integrate innovation into the music industry. Through my work at Master Música, I’ve been able to create and implement technological solutions that make a real impact on musicians’ careers.

            I specialize in Fullstack development with expertise in Java, AWS, Docker, SQL, Node.js, JavaScript, Agile Scrum, and QA. With a deep understanding of both technology and the arts, I’m able to bridge these two worlds to deliver solutions that are both creative and effective.
            
            My vision is to continue pushing the boundaries of what is possible at the intersection of music and technology, developing tools that empower artists to innovate and succeed in the digital era.</p>
